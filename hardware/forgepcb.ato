    Feature F002: Power and Signal Subsystems
    Two-PCB architecture: Power PCB + DBB (Digital Backbone)

    System Overview:
    ================

    Power PCB:
    - External 24V power brick input (90-264VAC → 24VDC conversion)
    - Input protection: 10A blade fuse, locking connector
    - Fixed rails: 5V @ 5A, 3.3V @ 3A (synchronous buck converters)
    - Variable bay: 0-24V @ 3A (adjustable module, banana outputs)
    - eFuse protection: 3× channels (5V, 3.3V, variable bay)
    - User interface: Rocker switches, LEDs, fault reset buttons

    DBB (Digital Backbone):
    - Bus headers: I²C, UART, SPI, RS-485 (Dupont, separate blocks)
    - Configuration: DIP switches for pull-ups, termination, voltage selection
    - Debug corner: 16-channel logic analyzer header
    - Clean signal routing (separated from high-power zones)

    Power Flow:
    ===========
    1. 24V input → Power PCB input stage (fuse, connector)
    2. 24V → Buck converters → 5V, 3.3V rails
    3. 24V → Variable bay module → 0-24V adjustable output
    4. Rails → eFuse protection → Protected outputs
    5. Protected outputs → DBB → Bus headers and debug

    Interface Between PCBs:
    =======================
    Power PCB → DBB:
    - 5V_OUT: Protected 5V rail (up to 5A)
    - 3V3_OUT: Protected 3.3V rail (up to 3A)
    - GND: Common ground plane
    - FAULT_5V, FAULT_3V3: Fault telemetry (optional)

    Physical connection: Ribbon cable or high-current header

    Physical Architecture:
    ======================
    - Two separate PCBs (Power PCB + DBB)
    - Power PCB: Mounted in high-power zone of enclosure
    - DBB: Mounted in clean signal zone of enclosure
    - Enclosure zones: Input, conversion, protection, variable bay, bus headers, debug
    - Front panel: Switches, LEDs, banana jacks (Power PCB)
    - Front/side panel: Bus headers, DIP switches, LA header (DBB)

    §4.10: Logic analyzer (16-channel header, debug corner) ✓
    §4.11: Power distribution (multiple taps, eFuse-protected) ✓

    Excluded Scope (Not Implemented):
    ==================================
    - MCU carriers (ESP32-S3, RP2040 Pico) → Feature F003
    - Enclosure physical execution → Feature F004
    - Firmware tooling (USB hub, programming) → Feature F005
    - PCB layout, routing, DRC → Downstream work
